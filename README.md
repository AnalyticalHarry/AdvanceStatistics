•	Mean, Median, and Mode: Definitions, calculation methods, and interpretation.
•	Comparing the measures and understanding when each is appropriate to use.
•	Explaining the impact of outliers on these measures.

2.	Measures of Dispersion:
•	Range: Understanding how to calculate and interpret the range.
•	Variance and Standard Deviation: Definitions, calculation methods, and interpretation.
•	Coefficient of Variation: Understanding how to use this measure to compare variability in different datasets.

3.	Data Visualization:
•	Histograms: Creating and interpreting histograms to display the distribution of numerical data.
•	Bar Graphs: Using bar graphs to represent categorical data.
•	Boxplots: Constructing and analyzing boxplots to summarize and compare data.

4.	Probability Distributions:
•	Normal Distribution: Understanding the characteristics of the normal distribution, including the mean, standard deviation, and empirical rule.
•	Binomial Distribution: Defining and working with binomial distributions, including calculating probabilities and understanding the parameters involved.
