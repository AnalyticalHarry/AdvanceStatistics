1. What are Qualitative vs. Quantitative?

Qualitative Data: Descriptive, categorical data that represents characteristics or categories (e.g., colors, names, labels).
Quantitative Data: Numerical data that can be measured or counted (e.g., height, age, weight).

2. When to Use?

Qualitative Data: When you are dealing with categories, classifications, or attributes (e.g., gender, product type, survey responses).
Quantitative Data: When you are working with measurable quantities or numeric values (e.g., temperature, number of items).

3. Advantages and Disadvantages:

Qualitative Data:

Advantages: Captures in-depth insights, especially in social sciences. Easy to collect from surveys and interviews.
Disadvantages: Harder to analyze statistically. May require coding or categorization.

Quantitative Data:

Advantages: Easier to analyze using statistical methods. Can be visualized effectively.
Disadvantages: Lacks depth and context; might miss nuances captured by qualitative data.
